# Script to connect the two datasets

library(tidyverse)


# 1)  initial data loading ---------------------------------------------------------------
#new data 
# load and remove records without names or times as failed data collections
n<-read.csv("Data/PREMAPIntegration-PrescreenDataAll_DATA_2025-05-23_1003.csv") %>%

# old data
# remove those without a name, all lack other data and are marked as tests or failed data entries

    as_tibble %>%
    filter(pscreen_name!="")


# 2) remove incorrect old data from new data frae ---------------------------------------------
# filter out everthing from before the new dataset - these were merged in an error-prone way
# this also removes 4 rows that do not have prescreendate values, but all have timestamp values 
#showing they are from the old dataset
n<-n %>%
    mutate(prescreendate=as_date(prescreendate))%>% 
    filter(!(prescreendate < "2024-11-12") |is.na(prescreendate)) %>%
    arrange(prescreendate)


# 3) remove multiple record collection events per person ------------------------------------------------------
# remove multiple records fro mthe sam person (using emails as they must be unique)
# always favoring the last record on assumption that multiple collection efforts reflect
# the need to repeat

# remove second occurances on people in new data collection effort
n<-n[!duplicated(n$email ),]

#remove second occurance of people in old data collection effort
o<-o[  !(duplicated(o$pscreen_email) & o$pscreen_email!="") ,]

#remove people from old data collection effort who subsequnelt came and had data collected in the new effort
o<-o[ ! o$pscreen_email %in% 
    n$email,]


# 4) remove anyone from @yale.edu domain; these are tests ------------------------------------------------------
n<-n[!str_detect(n$email, "@yale.edu"),]
o<-o[!str_detect(o$pscreen_email, "@yale.edu"),]



# 5) align columns between old and new dataframes --------------------------------------------------------------------
